#What is this?
This is my custom WordPress theme that I use on my web site, [The Open Source Ninja](https://theopensource.ninja). It's a child of the [Twenty Fourteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfourteen/) theme, so you must have that theme installed to use this one. I don't imagine I'll be making a whole lot of commits to this Git repo; I'm fairly satisfied with the theme as it is.

#Third-party includes
This theme depends on the following fonts; you will need to download them separately and put them in the fonts/ directory:

* [Comic Neue](http://comicneue.com/) and Comic Neue Angular (all variants and in all four formats for compatibility: .eot, .ttf, .woff, and .woff2)
* [Nina](https://archive.org/details/NinaPaleyFonts) or [Nina Improved](https://github.com/TheOpenSourceNinja/Nina-Improved) (medium variant only, and only in .ttf because I don't know how to convert to other formats)

This theme also depends on the two standard RSS feed icons from [FeedIcons.com](http://feedicons.com); you will need to download them and place them in the images/ directory:

* feed-icon-14x14.png
* feed-icon-28x28.png
